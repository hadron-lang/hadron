## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take the security of Hadron seriously. If you discover a security vulnerability (e.g., buffer overflow in the
compiler, generated code vulnerability, etc.), please **do not open a public issue**.

### How to report

   [Private Vulnerability Reporting](https://github.com/hadron-lang/hadron/security/advisories/new) feature on GitHub
   if available.
2. **Email**: If private reporting is not enabled, please email **security@hadronlang.com**.

We will make every effort to acknowledge your report within 48 hours and provide a fix as soon as possible.
